# Sail

Sail is a .NET-based gateway solution built using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy). It offers a user-friendly visual interface for easy management and configuration of proxy rules. Additionally, the project extends YARP to enhance its functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of complex application scenarios.

## Features

- **Visual Interface**: Intuitive UI for quick configuration and management of routes.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Easily set dynamic route rules with real-time updates.
- **Extensibility**: Extend YARP's built-in features through a plugin mechanism, supporting custom middleware and routing strategies.
- **High Performance**: Leverages YARP's efficient processing capabilities for fast and reliable request forwarding.
- **Security Management**: Integrated authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data transmission security.

This project is suitable for enterprise-level applications requiring flexible configuration and high-performance request forwarding, providing users with an all-in-one reverse proxy solution.
